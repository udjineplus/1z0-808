/*
G. Line 5 does not compile. This question is checking to see if you are paying attention to the types. numFish is an int and 1 is an int. Therefore, we use numeric addition and get 5. The problem is that we canâ€™t store an int in a String variable. Supposing line 5 said String anotherFish = numFish + 1 + "";. In that case, the answer would be options A and D. The variable defined on line 5 would be the string "5", and both output statements would use concatenation.
