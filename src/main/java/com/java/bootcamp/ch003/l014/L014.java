/*
A, C. The reverse() method is the easiest way of reversing the characters in a StringBuilder; therefore, option A is correct. Option B is a nice distractionâ€”it does in fact return "avaJ". However, substring() returns a String, which is not stored anywhere. Option C uses method chaining. First it creates the value "JavavaJ$". Then it removes the first three characters, resulting in "avaJ$". Finally, it removes the last character, resulting in "avaJ". Option D throws an exception because you cannot delete the character after the last index. Remember that deleteCharAt() uses indexes that are zero based and length() counts starting with 1.
