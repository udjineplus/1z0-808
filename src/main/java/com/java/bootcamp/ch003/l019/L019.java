/*
A. Two arrays with the same content are equal.
B. Two ArrayLists with the same content are equal.
C. If you call remove(0) using an empty ArrayList object, it will compile successfully.
D. If you call remove(0) using an empty ArrayList object, it will run successfully.
E. None of the above.
*/

/*
B, C. An array does not override equals() and so uses object equality. ArrayList does override equals() and defines it as the same elements in the same order. The compiler does not know when an index is out of bounds and thus canâ€™t give you a compiler error. The code will throw an exception at runtime, though.
