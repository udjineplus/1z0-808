A. rum
B. rum4
C. rumb4
D. rumble4
E. An exception is thrown.
F. The code does not compile.

/*
 F. This is a trick question. The first line does not compile because you cannot assign a String to a StringBuilder. If that line were StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder("rumble"), the code would compile and print rum4. Watch out for this sort of trick on the exam. You could easily spend a minute working out the character positions for no reason at all.
