/*
A. import aquarium.*;
B. import aquarium.Water; import aquarium.jellies.*;
C. import aquarium.*; import aquarium.jellies.Water;
D. import aquarium.*; import aquarium.jellies.*;
E. import aquarium.Water; import aquarium.jellies.Water;
F. None of these imports can make the code compile.
*/

/*
A, B, C. Option A is correct because it imports all the classes in the aquarium package including aquarium.Water. Options B and C are correct because they import Water by classname. Since importing by classname takes precedence over wildcards, these compile. Option D is incorrect because Java doesnâ€™t know which of the two wildcard Water
classes to use. Option E is incorrect because you cannot specify the same classname in two imports.
