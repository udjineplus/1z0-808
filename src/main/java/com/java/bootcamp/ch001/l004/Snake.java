A. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 2, the code will compile.

D. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 9, the code will compile.
E. None of the above changes will make the code compile.

/*
A, B. Adding the variable at line 2 makes result an instance variable. Since instance variables are in scope for the entire life of the object, option A is correct. Option B is correct because adding the variable at line 4 makes result a local variable with a scope of the whole method. Adding the variable at line 6 makes result a local variable with a scope of lines 6â€“7. Since it is out of scope on line 8, the println does not compile and option C is incorrect. Adding the variable at line 9 makes result a local variable with a scope of lines 9 and 10. Since line 8 is before the declaration, it does not compile and option D is incorrect. Finally, option E is incorrect because the code can be made to compile.
