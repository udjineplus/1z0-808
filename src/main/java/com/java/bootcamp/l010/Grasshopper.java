/*
 C, D, F. Immediately after line 9, only Grasshopper g1 is eligible for garbage collection since both one and two point to Grasshopper g2. Immediately after line 10, we still only have Grasshopper g1 eligible for garbage collection. Reference one points to g1 and reference two is null. Immediately after line 11, both Grasshopper objects are eligible for garbage collection since both one and two point to null. The code does compile. Although it is traditional to declare instance variables early in the class, you donâ€™t have to. For more information, see Chapter 1.
