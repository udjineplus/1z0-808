/*
F. In this example, the ternary operator has two expressions, one of them a String and the other a boolean value. The ternary operator is permitted to have expressions that donâ€™t have matching types, but the key here is the assignment to the String reference. The compiler knows how to assign the first expression value as a String, but the second boolean expression cannot be set as a String; therefore, this line will not compile.
