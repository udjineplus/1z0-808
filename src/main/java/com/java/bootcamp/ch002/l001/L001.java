A, D. Option A is the equality operator and can be used on numeric primitives, boolean values, and object references. Options B and C are both arithmetic operators and cannot be applied to a boolean value. Option D is the logical complement operator and is used exclusively with boolean values. Option E is the modulus operator, which can only be used with numeric primitives. Finally, option F is a relational operator that compares the values of two numbers.
